"This is Carl. He loves world peace and hates fighting. Which is why he just wants to engage in
dialogue with Liz (@arguetron) about her divisive opinions rather than start a flame war over 
them."

If you'd like to make a bot like Carl, check out this guide:

And you can use this code too, if you like. You'll need to have a `keys.py` file that contains
the constants `cons_key`, `cons_key_secret`, `access_token`, and `access_token_secret`, which 
store your Twitter auth keys (again see the article above).
